# Image Filtering System

Two different things were done in this system.
1. Images are filtered with a Gaussican filter to create the Gaussian blur
2. Two images are merged together to create one hybrid image with a lay over. This layover is done by merging a blurred image with an image filtered with a high-frequency filter
